# 42 Piscine

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate my knowledge about everything that has been learned during the **Piscine** days, and also to help new and former **pisciners**.

# Safety Instructions

### Swim trought the projects :swimmer:
Don't worry about doing everything perfect and don't stay stuck in the same project for a long time.Try to advance the projects at a constant pace. If an exercise appears that seems super complicated, don't hesitate to skip it. If you move forward with responsability, you will practice more and the concepts will be better consolidated. And in the end, you might be able to go back and solve the exercises that you have skipped.

### No cheating - Choose learning instead :mortar_board:
Here is the million dollar question: How am I going to do something that I have no idea how to do it? The answer is: use references.
```c
My_advice_to_learn()
{
    Try to write at least the basic structure by yoursef.
    
    while not understood
    {
        if you have no idea how to do it
        {
            open any of the exercises already solved
            and try to understand what is happening

            if it make sense
            {
                write the code
            }
            else if you can't make it by yoursef
            {
                transcribe the code
                this helps at the time of learning

                if it doesn't make any sense
                {
                    copy the code
                    run
                    and see what it does
                }
                else if it still doesn't make sense
                {
                    use the Python Tutor to see step by step what the code does
                    or use the VS Code debug tool
                }
                After that
                try to rewrite the code by memory
                or transcribe with consultation
            }
        }
        In the end, knowledge will be consolidated because
        if you study a code that much, you end up learning it
    }
}
```

### Practice, Practice, Practice... :clock7:
Take some time during the week to practice the exam exercises. The more you practice the better you will become. Remember, the exam is a way to assess your learning.

Enjoy swimming! :swimmer: :dart:

> **NOTE:** If you want to deepen your studies at home and keep a similar environment to the one at school, I recommend using the Linux system on your personal computer. Here is a [link](https://medium.com/linuxforeveryone/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-and-dual-boot-alongside-windows-10-323a85271a73)  with further instructions that teaches you how to install Linux on a Windowns computer.
