# Exams Practice

Try to do the exercises as it happens on an exam day.
1. On one side of the screen open the `subject` file.
2. On the other side open a new file on `vim` to write the program. I recommend leaving this new file in the `rendu` folder.

If you have any questions, the exercises are commented on the Subject folder for consult. Don't hesitate to consult. The time to consult is now at training time. The more you practice, the more consolidated your knowledge gets.
